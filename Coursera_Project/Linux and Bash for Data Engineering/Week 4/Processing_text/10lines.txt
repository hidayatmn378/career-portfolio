Capacity in Stainless Steel",Major Appliances,4,4,5,N,N,Really nice fridge!,"We recently replaced our Samsung, which in the 4 years since we bought it, had broken for the third time. We chose this LG which we have been happy with and there are a few features which make it really unique. We are a soccer family; coach, ref and both of our girls play, so we go through a LOT of ice. This fridge has two ice makers AND the ice cubes are smaller so when you are holding a sports water bottle up to the ice shute, the ice falls right in where old sized ice used to get stuck in the opening. It makes ice fast and the water is nice and cold which really helps. The rest of the features on the fridge are great too. The door-in-door works as expected although you have to make sure it is shut or else it will pop open. In addition, I would swear that our veggies and fruits are staying fresher longer. The space is organized well too. If I had one complaint it would be the location of the water spout. If you look closely at the picture, you would assume it comes out at the same location as the ice like most fridges but it doesn't; it comes out in the space above it which means it is above the eye level of smaller kids (say age 9 on down) and also is confusing to guests. Everyone who comes in the house uses their hand to push the water button with the cup in the ice area and it shoots water out down the front of them. It's kinda funny in a way but then there's the clean up to consider and people feel badly for making a mess which of course is silly but it is what it is. I have taken to giving people a run down of the fridge when they come for the first time and that works but is a bit of an inconvenience, especially if I forget. I don't know yet about the longevity of the fridge but if it is anything like the trouble free 10 years we have gotten out of our LG washer/dryer then I think we will be happy. The water also tastes really nice too. Very clean, like Ozarka.",8/23/15,POSITIVE
